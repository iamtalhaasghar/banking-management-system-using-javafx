Banking Management System

**Introduction:**

The banking management system is an application for maintaining a
person’s account in a bank. The system provides the access to the
customer to request the creation of his account, deposit/withdraw the
cash from his account and also to view all the transactions he had done
since the creation of his account plus many more.

**Characteristics of My Banking Management System:**

In this project, I aim to develop a software for maintaining financial
information of a customer in E-Banking or Online-Banking environment in
order to nurture (to take care and protect) his needs and requirements
by providing various ways to perform banking tasks easily and
efficiently. My Banking Management system will also enable the user’s
workspace to have additional functionalities which are not provided
under a conventional banking software. Few of them are listed below:

-   *Virtual ATM* (ATM Simulation)

-   *A Virtual Agent* as a representative of Bank for Customer Care and Help

-   *E-Billing* or *Online Billing* of Utility Bills

-   *E-Currency Exchange*

**Graphical Design/Properties:**

My Banking Management System is a GUI based application with an
interactive interface. The major and important elements of the
application are:

-   *Main Menu* which lists all the core functionality available in the Banking Management System

-   *Administrator Login Portal* and *Admin Dashboard*

-   *Customer Login Portal* and *Customer Dashboard*

-   *E-Billing* or *Online Billing Portal*

**Object Oriented based System:**

My Banking Management System is totally an Objected Oriented System
based on core and important Object Oriented Programming Concepts like
Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Interfaces and Polymorphism etc.

However, the following advanced programming concepts are also
implemented where they were found suitable:

1.  *Database Management using SQLite and JDBC*

2.  *Multi-Threaded Programming*

3.  *Socket Programming (use of Datagram Socket and Datagram Packets)*

**GUI in JFX 8 and Platform Independency:**

The complete interface of the Banking Management System have been made
and customized using the new GUI technology of Java, JFX 8. The
application is *platform independent* as it is developed using purely
Java Source Code.

**Overview of Banking Management System:**

From a Programmers\` point of view the Banking Management System
consists of following key Elements:

The banking management System contains three custom java packages and
multiples .class and .java files within those packages.

These three packages namely are:

1.  ***The Bank Package***: It includes the .class and .java files which
    represents key elements of a bank.

2.  ***The Interfaces Package***: It includes the .class and .java files
    which define the GUI Interfaces of the application.

3.  ***The Data Package***: It include the .class and .java files for
    data validation and manipulation involved in and being used by
    application.

**Hierarchal View of the Application:**

The Hierarchal view of the software is given below:

**Hierarchal View of the “*Bank*” package:**

**(Package # 1)**

**Hierarchal View of the “*Interfaces*” package:**

**(Package # 2)**

**Hierarchal View of the “*Data*” package:**

**(Package # 3)**
